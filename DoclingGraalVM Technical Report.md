## 1. Executive Summary

- Brief statement of project goal: in-process Docling integration in Java via GraalVM polyglot
- Summary of what was achieved: `DocumentConverter` imports successfully in GraalPy; PDF conversion blocked at runtime
- Summary of the working solution delivered: subprocess-based IPC (`PythonRunner.java`) confirmed functional
- Key blocker identified: GraalPy's C FFI cannot convert Python callables to native C function pointers (`pypdfium2` CFUNCTYPE callbacks)
- Disposition of findings: shared with the Docling team; three architectural workarounds proposed

---

## 2. Introduction & Background

### 2.1 What Is Docling?
- Open-source AI-powered document conversion toolkit (Python)
- Supports PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, images → structured output (Markdown, JSON)
- Relies heavily on ML libraries (PyTorch, pypdfium2) for layout analysis and OCR

### 2.2 What Is GraalVM?
- High-performance JDK with polyglot support (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- GraalPy: GraalVM's Python runtime, embedded via the Polyglot API
- Enables multiple languages to run in a single JVM process with shared memory

### 2.3 Existing Docling–Java Integration
- `docling-serve`: HTTP-based Java API — functional but introduces network overhead and deployment complexity
- Goal: replace HTTP IPC with direct in-process interop via GraalPy

---

## 3. Problem Definition

### 3.1 Core Objective
- Eliminate the HTTP layer between Java and Docling
- Run `DocumentConverter.convert()` directly inside the JVM via GraalVM's Polyglot Context

### 3.2 Technical Constraints
- Docling is Python-only; no native Java SDK exists
- GraalPy must faithfully emulate CPython's C extension ABI for Docling's dependencies to function
- Project must be buildable with standard tooling (Maven, GraalVM JDK 21)

### 3.3 Scope Boundaries
- Skipped: full ML pipeline (PyTorch, torchvision, accelerate, scipy) — not required for basic PDF conversion
- Skipped: OCR on scanned documents (rapidocr dependency)
- Focus: structured PDF → Markdown conversion via `DocumentConverter`

---

## 4. Methodology & Approach

### 4.1 Team Structure
- 4-person team; 3 members working in isolated repositories to test different environment configurations without interference
- 1 member dedicated to documentation: recording progress, failed attempts, and reproducible setups

### 4.2 Incremental Validation Strategy
- Step 1: Verify GraalPy works at all — run trivial Python (`print("Hello World")`)
- Step 2: Install and import lightweight pure-Python libraries (e.g., `qrcode`) to confirm pip and venv function
- Step 3: Attempt Docling import chain — identify blocking dependencies one at a time
- Step 4: Attempt actual `DocumentConverter.convert()` call with a real PDF

### 4.3 Environment
| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| GraalVM JDK | 21.0.10 |
| GraalPy | 25.0.2 |
| GraalVM Polyglot API (Maven) | 24.1.2 |
| OS | WSL2 Ubuntu |
| Build Tool | Maven |
| Python venv | `~/docling-env` |

### 4.4 Maven Project Configuration
- `graalpy-maven-plugin` used to manage `python-resources/venv` and `python-resources/home` at build time
- `python-embedding` artifact provides `GraalPyResources` API
- Main classes: `EmbedPythonTest.java` (polyglot context test), `PythonRunner.java` (subprocess IPC)

## 5. Technical Development & Findings

### 5.1 Stage 1 — Direct Import Attempt
- Installing Docling with all dependencies took hours and consistently failed
- Errors were not immediately obvious — pointed deeper into the dependency graph than surface-level config issues

### 5.2 Stage 2 — Root Cause: C Extensions
- Docling is written in pure Python but depends on native ML libraries
- **Primary blocker:** PyTorch (`torch`) — requires C extensions for GPU/CPU backends that GraalPy cannot execute
- GraalVM's own documentation classifies PyTorch compatibility as "mostly experimental"
- Two confirming tests:
  - Full Docling `convert()` call → Torch pulled in as a transitive dependency → failure
  - Isolated GraalVM program importing Torch directly → failure at the same native boundary

### 5.3 Stage 3 — Dependency Isolation
- Reinstalled Docling with `--no-deps`; manually resolved ~15 transitive dependencies
- Batched pure-Python deps: `beautifulsoup4`, `marko`, `openpyxl`, `pluggy`, `pylatexenc`, `python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `requests`, `lxml`, `polyfactory`, `pypdfium2`, `rtree`
- Compiled `lxml` from source against system `libxml2`/`libxslt`

### 5.4 Stage 4 — Targeted Patches Applied

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|
| `POINTER(None)` TypeError | GraalPy ctypes rejects `POINTER(None)` | Patched `pypdfium2_raw/bindings.py` — replaced all occurrences with `c_void_p` via `sed` |
| `LookupError: euc_jis_2004` | `charset_normalizer` 3.4+ enumerates all codecs at import; GraalPy missing `euc_jis_2004` | Pinned `charset_normalizer==3.3.2` |
| `PackageNotFoundError: docling-ibm-models` | Installed with `--no-deps`; metadata lookup still runs at import | Installed `docling-ibm-models` with `--no-deps` to satisfy version check |
| `lxml` build failure | Missing system headers | `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: filetype` | Not pulled in with no-deps install | Installed `filetype` separately |

### 5.5 Stage 5 — Current Blocker: pypdfium2 Callback Failure
- After all patches, `from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter` **succeeds**
- Calling `converter.convert(pdf_path)` fails at runtime:
  - `pypdfium2`'s `get_bufreader()` function attempts to register a Python callable as a native C function pointer via `set_callback` (a `CFUNCTYPE` object)
  - GraalPy throws: `Cannot convert Object pointer to native`
  - All Docling PDF backends (v2, v4, default) route through this code path
- Root cause: GraalPy's C FFI implementation cannot materialize native function pointers from Python callables — a known architectural limitation

## 6. IPC Workaround — Subprocess Approach (Working Solution)

> This is the approach that **works end-to-end** today. See [`EmbededPythonTest.java`](<https://github.com/galaxyman2424/doclingGraalvm/blob/processbuilder/src/main/java/EmbedPythonTest.java>) for the full implementation.

### 6.1 How It Works
- Java constructs a self-contained Python script as a string at runtime
- The script imports `DocumentConverter`, runs `convert()`, and writes the Markdown output to a file
- Java launches the **native CPython executable** (inside the Docling venv) as a subprocess via `ProcessBuilder`
- Java captures stdout/stderr and the exit code; the output file is read back into Java

### 6.2 Architecture Diagram

```
Java (JVM)
   │
   ├─ Builds Python script string
   ├─ Spawns ProcessBuilder → native Python (venv/Scripts/python.exe)
   │       │
   │       └─ Runs Docling DocumentConverter.convert(pdf_path)
   │               └─ Writes Markdown → output.txt
   │
   └─ Reads output.txt back into Java
```

### 6.3 Key Implementation Details
- Path configuration is done via string constants at the top of `main()` — easily adapted
- `validateSetup()` checks that both the PDF file and Python executable exist before attempting conversion
- `ProcessBuilder.redirectErrorStream(true)` merges stderr into stdout for unified capture
- Exit code checked post-`waitFor()` to distinguish success from Python-level failures
- No GraalVM polyglot API involved — works on any standard JDK

### 6.4 Tradeoffs vs. In-Process Embedding

| Aspect | Subprocess (working) | GraalPy Embedding (blocked) |
|---|---|---|
| Works today | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| In-process (shared memory) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Startup overhead | Higher (new process per call) | Lower (context reuse) |
| Deployment complexity | Requires Python venv on host | Self-contained JAR |
| Full Docling ML pipeline | ✅ Yes (native CPython) | ❌ Blocked (C FFI) |
| Production suitability | ✅ Suitable | ❌ Not yet |

### 6.5 Why This Is Still Valuable
- Delivers the end-to-end Docling PDF → Markdown pipeline from Java today
- No GraalVM-specific patches or workarounds required
- Can be used as a drop-in for `docling-serve` without HTTP overhead in single-host deployments
- Provides a stable baseline while polyglot embedding is pursued upstream

---

## 7. Key Insights

- GraalPy is viable for pure-Python libraries but breaks down at native C extension boundaries — specifically ctypes `CFUNCTYPE` callbacks
- Docling's dependency on PyTorch (via `docling-ibm-models`) is the primary blocker for ML-powered layout analysis; basic conversion has a narrower dependency surface
- Incremental dependency isolation (installing with `--no-deps`, then resolving manually) is the correct strategy for embedding large Python frameworks in GraalPy
- The `POINTER(None)` → `c_void_p` patch is a generalizable fix for any package using void pointer ctypes signatures under GraalPy
- The subprocess IPC pattern is a pragmatic, production-grade fallback that should be the default recommendation for student-level projects

---

## 8. Limitations & Challenges

### 8.1 Technical Limitations
- GraalPy cannot materialize native C function pointers from Python callables (CFUNCTYPE callbacks) — architectural, not a configuration issue
- PyTorch C extensions are incompatible with GraalPy; GraalVM classifies Torch support as "mostly experimental"
- `huggingface-hub` and `typer` version conflicts remain unresolved (not yet downgraded to compatible versions)
- `EmbedPythonTest.java` polyglot context has not been tested end-to-end against `DocumentConverter`

### 8.2 Project Constraints
- Student team with a fixed timeline — complex solutions (JNI, GraalVM patching) are out of scope
- WSL2 environment adds cross-platform complexity for Windows/Linux path handling
- GraalPy-compatible wheels are not available for most ML libraries; source compilation required

## 9. Proposed Solutions & Alternatives

> Full analysis of each solution is documented in [`Solutions_Section.docx`](<https://github.com/galaxyman2424/doclingenv/blob/main/GRAALPY_DOCLING_COMPATIBILITY.md>).

### 9.1 Solution 1 — JNI Wrapper for PDFium
- **What:** Direct Java-to-C bridge via JNI, bypassing pypdfium2 and Python ctypes entirely
- **Effort:** ~400–600 hours; requires C expertise, cross-platform toolchain, JVM internals knowledge
- **Verdict:** Not feasible for a student team

### 9.2 Solution 2 — Patch GraalVM's LLVM Bitcode Interop
- **What:** Add trampolining support to GraalVM's native interop layer so CFUNCTYPE callbacks can be converted to C function pointers
- **Effort:** 600+ hours; requires GraalVM source-level expertise; patch may be rejected upstream
- **Verdict:** Effectively impossible for a student team; appropriate for a GraalVM core contributor

### 9.3 Solution 3 — Replace pypdfium2 with a Pure-Python PDF Library
- **What:** Swap Docling's PDF backend for `pdfplumber` or `pypdf` (pure Python, no C extensions)
- **Effort:** ~100–150 hours
- **Verdict:** Technically feasible but eliminates Docling's core AI layout analysis; delivers a significantly degraded product

### 9.4 Recommended Approach (Pragmatic)
- **Use the subprocess IPC approach** (`PythonRunner.java`) for any production or demo use
- Pursue Solution 3 only if pure text extraction (no layout AI) is acceptable
- Monitor GraalPy's ctypes roadmap for CFUNCTYPE callback support upstream

---

## 10. Future Work

- **Patch `docling_parse_backend.py`** to pass PDF file paths as strings directly to `pdfium.PdfDocument()` instead of `BytesIO` buffers — this would invoke `FPDF_LoadDocument` (no callbacks) instead of `FPDF_LoadMemDocument` (broken callback path)
- **Downgrade `huggingface-hub`** to `<1.0` and `typer` to `<0.22.0` to clear remaining version conflicts
- **Test `EmbedPythonTest.java` end-to-end** once PDF path-based loading is confirmed working
- **Write a reproducible setup shell script** capturing all manual patches (`sed` commands, pinned versions, `apt` installs) so the environment can be rebuilt without repeating each fix
- **Engage GraalVM upstream** — file an issue or contribute a fix for CFUNCTYPE callback conversion; this would unblock not just Docling but any Python library using ctypes callbacks under GraalPy
- **Explore GraalVM Native Image** compilation of the subprocess runner for reduced startup latency

---

## 11. Conclusion

- The team was unable to achieve fully in-process Docling PDF conversion via GraalPy due to a fundamental C FFI limitation in GraalVM's CFUNCTYPE callback handling
- The failure was not a configuration error — it is an architectural gap in GraalPy's current implementation
- Despite this, the team successfully: isolated the exact failure point in `pypdfium2`'s buffer reader; got `DocumentConverter` to import cleanly in GraalPy; and delivered a working end-to-end PDF → Markdown pipeline via subprocess IPC
- Findings and repositories were shared with the Docling team
- The subprocess approach (`PythonRunner.java`) is the recommended production path until GraalPy's C FFI matures
- This project surfaced concrete, actionable data points for the GraalPy and Docling ecosystems — a meaningful contribution even without a fully working in-process integration
